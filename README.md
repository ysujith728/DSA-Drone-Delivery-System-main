# 🚀 DSA Drone Delivery System  

A **Java-based Smart Drone Delivery System** built using **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to simulate how modern logistics companies manage package delivery using autonomous drones.

This project combines **algorithmic thinking + system design + object-oriented programming**, making it a powerful **resume-ready project**.

---

## 🌟 Why This Project Is Special

✅ Real-world logistics simulation  
✅ Strong use of DSA concepts  
✅ System design + scheduling logic  
✅ Interview-ready project  
✅ Perfect for CSE / IT students  
✅ Highly extendable to real-world applications

## 📌 Project Overview

The **DSA Drone Delivery System** simulates how a fleet of drones can deliver packages efficiently using:

- Request Queues  
- Route Planning  
- Drone Allocation  
- Scheduling Algorithms  

It models how companies like **Amazon, Swiggy, Zepto, and logistics startups** could automate deliveries using drones.
